                This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is
                collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase
                from LungReset.com (the “Site”).
              </p>
              <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h2>
              <p>
                When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain
                information about your device, including information about
                your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the
                cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as
                you browse the Site, we collect information about the
                individual web pages or products that you view, what websites
                or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
                about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
                automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.
              </p>
              <p>
                By using our website, you (the visitor) agree to allow third
                parties to process your IP address, in order to determine your
                location for the purpose of currency conversion. You also
                agree to have that currency stored in a session cookie in your
                browser (a temporary cookie which gets automatically removed
                when you close your browser). We do this in order for the
                selected currency to remain selected and consistent when
                browsing our website so that the prices can convert to your
                (the visitor) local currency."
              </p>
              <p>
                We collect Device Information using the following
                technologies: - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on
                your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique
                identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to
                disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. - “Log
                files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data
                including your IP address, browser type, Internet service
                provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. - “Web
                beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to
                record information about how you browse the Site.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a
                purchase through the Site, we collect certain information from
                you, including your name, billing address, shipping address,
                payment information (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone
                number. We refer to this information as “Order Information”.
              </p>
              <p>
                When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy
                Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order
                Information.
              </p>
              <h2>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
              <p>
                We use the Order Information that we collect generally to
                fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including
                processing your payment information, arranging for shipping,
                and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).
                Additionally, we use this Order Information to: - Communicate
                with you; - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us,
                provide you with information or advertising relating to our
                products or services.
              </p>
              <p>
                We use the Device Information that we collect to help us
                screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP
                address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site
                (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers
                browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success
                of our marketing and advertising campaigns).
              </p>
              <h2>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
              <p>
                We share your Personal Information with third parties to help
                us use your Personal Information, as described above. For
                example, we use Shopify to power our online store--you can
                read more about how Shopify uses your Personal Information
                here: https://www.shopify.com/legal/privacy. We also use
                Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use
                the Site -- you can read more about how Google uses your
                Personal Information here:
                https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/. You can also

              </p>
              <p>
                The above excludes text messaging originator opt-in data and
                consent; this information will not be shared with any third
                parties.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply
                with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a
                subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for
                information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.
              </p>
