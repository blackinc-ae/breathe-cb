                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>The following Privacy Policy governs the online information collection practices of
                            Breathe
                            ("we" or "us"). Specifically, it outlines the types of information that we gather
                            about you while you are using the www.breatheagain.io & www.lungreset.com website
                            (the "Site"), and the ways in
                            which we use this information. This Privacy Policy, including our children's privacy
                            statement,
                            does not apply to any information you may provide to us or that we may collect
                            offline and/or
                            through other means (for example, at a live event, via telephone, or through the
                            mail).</p>
                        <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting and using the Site, you agree
                            that your
                            use of our Site, and any dispute over privacy, is governed by this Privacy Policy.
                            Because the
                            Web is an evolving medium, we may need to change our Privacy Policy at some point in
                            the future,
                            in which case we'll post the changes to this Privacy Policy on this website and
                            update the
                            Effective Date of the policy to reflect the date of the changes. By continuing to
                            use the Site
                            after we post any such changes, you accept the Privacy Policy as modified.</p>
                        <h3>How We Collect and Use Information</h3>
                        <p>We may collect and store personal or other information that you voluntarily supply to
                            us online
                            while using the Site (e.g., while on the Site or in responding via email to a
                            feature provided
                            on the Site). The Site only contacts individuals who specifically request that we do
                            so or in
                            the event that they have signed up to receive our messaging, attended one of our
                            events, or have
                            purchased one of our products. The Site collects personally identifying information
                            from our
                            users during online registration and online purchasing. Generally, this information
                            includes
                            name and e-mail address for registration or opt-in purposes and name, postal
                            address, and credit
                            card information when registering for our events or purchasing our products. All of
                            this
                            information is provided to us by you.</p>
                        <p>We also collect and store information that is generated automatically as you navigate
                            online
                            through the Site. For example, we may collect information about your computer's
                            connection to
                            the Internet, which allows us, among other things, to improve the delivery of our
                            web pages to
                            you and to measure traffic on the Site. We also may use a standard feature found in
                            browser
                            software called a "cookie" to enhance your experience with the Site. Cookies are
                            small files
                            that your web browser places on your hard drive for record-keeping purposes. By
                            showing how and
                            when visitors use the Site, cookies help us deliver advertisements, identify how
                            many unique
                            users visit us, and track user trends and patterns. They also prevent you from
                            having to
                            re-enter your preferences on certain areas of the Site where you may have entered
                            preference
                            information before. The Site also may use web beacons (single-pixel graphic files
                            also known as
                            "transparent GIFs") to access cookies and to count users who visit the Site or open
                            HTML-formatted email messages.</p>
                        <p>We use the information we collect from you while you are using the Site in a variety
                            of ways,
                            including using the information to customize features; advertising that appear on
                            the Site; and,
                            making other offers available to you via email, direct mail or otherwise. We also
                            may provide
                            your information to third parties, such as service providers, contractors and
                            third-party
                            publishers. Unless you inform us in accordance with the process described below, we
                            reserve the
                            right to use all of the information collected from and about you while you are using
                            the Site
                            such as to enable us to provide you with information about products and services. If
                            you do not
                            wish your information to be used for these purposes, you must send a letter to the
                            Online
                            Privacy Coordinator whose address is listed at the end of this Privacy Policy
                            requesting to be
                            taken off any lists of information that may be used for these purposes or that may
                            be given or
                            sold to third-parties.</p>
                        <p>Please keep in mind that whenever you voluntarily make your personal information
                            available for
                            viewing by third parties online - for example on message boards, web logs, through
                            email, or in
                            chat areas - that information can be seen, collected and used by others besides us.
                            We cannot be
                            responsible for any unauthorized third-party use of such information.</p>
                        <p>Some of our third-party advertisers and ad servers that place and present advertising
                            on the Site also may collect
                            information from you via cookies, email, web beacons or similar technologies. These
                            third-party advertisers and ad servers may use the information they collect to help
                            present
                            their advertisements, to help measure and research the advertisements'
                            effectiveness, or for
                            other purposes. The use and collection of your information by these third-party
                            advertisers and
                            ad servers is governed by the relevant third-party's privacy policy and is not
                            covered by our
                            Privacy Policy. Indeed, the privacy policies of these third-party advertisers and ad
                            servers may
                            be different from ours. If you have any concerns about a third party's use of
                            cookies or web
                            beacons or use of your information, you should visit that party's website and review
                            its privacy
                            policy.</p>
                        <p>The Site also includes links to other websites and provides access to products and
                            services
                            offered by third parties, whose privacy policies we do not control. When you access
                            another
                            website or purchase third-party products or services through the Site, use of any
                            information
                            you provide is governed by the privacy policy of the operator of the site you are
                            visiting or
                            the provider of such products or services.</p>
                        <p>We may also make some content, products and services available through our Site or by
                            emailing
                            messages to you through cooperative relationships with third-party providers, where
                            the brands
                            of our provider partner appear on the Site in connection with such content, products
                            and/or
                            services. We may share with our provider partner any information you provide, or
                            that is
                            collected, in the course of visiting any pages that are made available in
                            cooperation with our
                            provider partner. In some cases, the provider partner may collect information from
                            you directly,
                            in which cases the privacy policy of our provider partner may apply to the provider
                            partner's
                            use of your information. The privacy policy of our provider partners may differ from
                            ours. If
                            you have any questions regarding the privacy policy of one of our provider partners,
                            you should
                            contact the provider partner directly for more information. Your email address will
                            never be
                            shared with any third parties without your explicit permission via an opt-in page.
                        </p>
                        <p>Be aware that we may occasionally release information about our visitors when release
                            is
                            appropriate to comply with law or to protect the rights, property or safety of users
                            of the Site
                            or the public.</p>
                        <p>Please also note that as our business grows, we may buy or sell various assets. In
                            the unlikely
                            event that we sell some or all of our assets, or one or more of our websites is
                            acquired by
                            another company, information about our users may be among the transferred assets.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Google Analytics</h3>
                        <p>We also use Google Analytics Advertiser Features to optimize our business. Advertiser
                            features
                            include:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>By enabling these Google Analytics Display features, we are required to notify our
                            visitors by
                            disclosing the use of these features and that we and third-party vendors use
                            first-party cookies
                            (such as the Google Analytics cookie) or other first-party identifiers, and
                            third-party cookies
                            (such as the DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to gather
                            data about
                            your activities on our Site. Among other uses, this allows us to contact you if you

                            you to
                            complete your order. The “Remarketing” feature allows us to reach people who
                            previously visited our Site, and match the right audience with the right advertising
                            message.
